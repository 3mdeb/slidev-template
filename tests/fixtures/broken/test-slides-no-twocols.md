# BROKEN - This Is NOT Two Columns

This content is completely different to ensure visual regression is detected.

The original slide had a two-cols layout with left and right columns.

Now it's just a regular slide with plain text that looks nothing like the original.

<!--
two-cols is the second most used layout (19 times in real usage).
