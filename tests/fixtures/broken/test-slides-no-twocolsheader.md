# BROKEN - This Is NOT Two Columns Header

This content is completely different to ensure visual regression is detected.

The original slide had a two-cols-header layout with left and right columns.

Now it's just a regular slide with plain text that looks nothing like the original.

This should definitely trigger a screenshot mismatch.
