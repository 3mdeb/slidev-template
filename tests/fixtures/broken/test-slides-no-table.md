# Table Styling

<style>
table, th, td { font-size: 0.8rem !important; }
th { text-align: left !important; }
</style>

The table that should be here is completely missing.

Instead you see this paragraph explaining that the table is gone.

No features, no status, no notes columns.

Inline styles are commonly used to customize tables.
